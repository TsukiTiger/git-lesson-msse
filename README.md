# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of using git for verson control.

To make a commit (version, checkpoint) of your files, follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep.
2. When you have your change, tell git you are ready to create a checkpoint of the files by using "git add <file name>"
3. Create a checkpoint using "git commit -m 'Message about what you did'"

## Adding Features
Features should be developed on branches. To create and switch a branch, usee the command:

'git switch -c new_branch_name'

To switch to an existing branch, use:

'git switch branch_name'
